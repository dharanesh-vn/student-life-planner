<!--
  This is the root of the entire application.
  Its ONLY purpose is to tell the Angular Router where to render the top-level components
  from your app.routes.ts file.

  Based on the URL and your login status, the router will inject either:
  1. The HomeComponent (which contains the "Gradify" branding and the login/register forms).
  OR
  2. The DashboardLayoutComponent (which contains the sidebar and all your main feature pages).
